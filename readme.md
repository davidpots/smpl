# Welcome to SMPL
This is a very small responsive grid framework that I've been working on. It's a series of common layout divisions that you apply to your own grid. Right now, everything is pretty experimental, but I look to be making some heavy modifications.

## View the demo
You can view the <a href="http://smpl.jaredcunha.com/">demo</a> for full instructions how on how to use.

## Take a look at these files
### /css/scss/_global_vars.scss
This is where you will need to add your grid maths: divided columns and gutters. 

### /css/scss/style.scss
The base CSS file with framework classes. You'll want to edit this heavily so it works for your site. 

### smpl.html
Basic HTML page showing the framework classes.
